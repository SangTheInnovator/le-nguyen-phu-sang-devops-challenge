## Here's a high level architecture design for a highly available, scalable, and cost-effective trading system similar to Binance deployed on AWS (Amazon Web Service).
<br>

### Architecture Overview
The system is designed with **high availability, low-latency, and scalability** in mind, using a **microservices-based architecture**, deployed across multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs). Below is an architecture diagram of the services used and what role they play in the system.

#### Architecture Diagram

#### Architure Diagram Components
- **Clients (Users, API Intergations)**
  - Access the system via Web, Mobile App, or REST APIs.
- **AWS Global CDN (Amazon CloudFront)**
  - Ensures low-latency access for users worldwide by caching static assets.
- **API Gateway (Amazon API Gateway)**
  - Manages REST API requests and handles authentication.
- **Load Balancer (Application Load Balancer - ALB)**
  - Distributed requests among backend services.
- **Microservices Layer (ECS Fargate, EKS)**
  - User Management (Cognito/RDS PostgreSQL):
    - Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management.
    - **Amazon Cognito:** Manages user sign-up, sign-in, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and identification parties (Goggle, Apple, etc.).
    - **RDS PostgreSQL:** Stores user data, permissions, and preferences in a relational database.
    - Ensures secure authentication and role-based access control.
  - Wallet & Funds Service (DynamoDB/PostgreSQL):
    - Manages user account balances, deposit
    - **DynamoDB(NoSQL, high-performance):**
      - Handles real-time walet balance updates.
      - Processes high-frequency transactions with low-latency reads/write.
    - **PostgreSQL:**
      - Ensures data integrity for critical financial records.
  - Order Management Service (DynamoDB/Aurora PostgreSQL):
  - Market Data Service (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch):
  - Trading Service (Elastic Kubernetes Cluster):
    - The core service that processes buy/sell orders with ultra-low latency.
    -  Ensures fast execution by leveraging Kubernetes for container orchestration.
    -  Can handle high throughput and scale dynamicaly to accommodate market fluctuations.
- **Data Storage**
  - Aurora PostgreSQL - For transactional data (trades, users)
  - DynamoDB - For NoSQL requirements (orders, user balances)
  - Amazon S3 - For storing historical trade logs, reports
- **Real-time Messaging (Amazon SNS/SQS, Kafka)**
  - SNS/SQS - Event-driven architecture for trade notifications
  - MSK (Kafka) - For low-latency event streaming between services
- **Caching Layer (ElastiCache - Redis)**
  - Improves response time for frequently accessed data
- **Logging & Monitoring**
  - AWS CloudWatch - Centralized logging & metric monitoring
  - AWS X-Ray - Tracing to diagnose latency issues
  - Prometheus/Grafana - Observability for Kubernetes services
- **Security**
  - AWS WAF - Protects against DDoS, SQL Injection
  - AWS Shield - DDoS protection
  - IAM Roles & Policies - Secure access control
  - Secrets Manager - Manages API keys, database credentials
